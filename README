ddserver is a server-side application for dynamic DNS management.

It allows you to specify names inside a dynamic DNS zone, allowing you to 
access hosts with dynamic IP addresses by the same name, even if the IP 
address changes. Updates of the IP addresses are performed using the Dynamic 
DNS Update Protocol, allowing homerouters that provide a DDNS client service 
or a tool like ddclient to send updates of the IP address.
